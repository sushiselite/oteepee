# OTeePee Onboarding Flow Test Plan

## Overview
The onboarding flow has been implemented to guide new users through the app setup process. Here's what has been added:

## New Components

### 1. OnboardingView.swift
- **4-step onboarding process**:
  1. Welcome screen with app introduction
  2. How it works explanation with feature highlights
  3. Permissions setup (Full Disk Access + Notifications)
  4. Completion screen with next steps

- **Features**:
  - Progress indicator showing current step
  - Navigation buttons (Back/Next/Get Started)
  - Permission status checking and granting
  - Privacy-focused messaging
  - Beautiful UI with animations

### 2. WindowManager.swift
- Centralized window management for onboarding and settings
- Proper window lifecycle management
- Environment object injection for SwiftUI views

### 3. Updated AppDelegate.swift
- First launch detection using UserDefaults
- Automatic onboarding window display for new users
- App activation policy management (dock vs menu bar only)

### 4. Enhanced NotificationManager.swift
- Added callback-based permission request methods
- Better permission status checking
- Support for onboarding flow integration

## Testing Steps

### First Launch (New User)
1. Delete app preferences: `defaults delete com.yourcompany.oteepee`
2. Launch the app
3. **Expected**: Onboarding window should appear automatically
4. **Expected**: App should appear in dock during onboarding
5. Go through each onboarding step:
   - Welcome screen: Should show app intro
   - How it works: Should explain features with privacy note
   - Permissions: Should show Full Disk Access and Notifications
   - Completion: Should show next steps

### Permission Flow
1. On permissions step, click "Grant Access" for Full Disk Access
2. **Expected**: System Preferences should open to Privacy settings
3. Grant Full Disk Access permission
4. Return to onboarding - status should update to "Granted"
5. Click "Grant Permission" for Notifications
6. **Expected**: macOS notification permission dialog should appear
7. Grant permission
8. **Expected**: Status should update to "Granted"

### Completion
1. Click "Get Started" on final step
2. **Expected**: Onboarding window should close
3. **Expected**: App should switch to menu bar only mode
4. **Expected**: `hasCompletedOnboarding` should be set to true
5. **Expected**: Menu bar icon should appear

### Returning User
1. Quit and relaunch the app
2. **Expected**: No onboarding window should appear
3. **Expected**: App should start in menu bar only mode
4. **Expected**: If permissions are missing, should show permission alert

### Settings Integration
1. Open settings from menu bar
2. Go to Settings tab
3. Click "Show Setup Guide"
4. **Expected**: Onboarding window should open again
5. **Expected**: Can go through onboarding again if needed

## Build and Run
```bash
xcodebuild -project OTeePee.xcodeproj -scheme OTeePee -configuration Debug build
```

The onboarding flow significantly improves the user experience by:
1. **Guiding new users** through the setup process
2. **Explaining the app's value** and how it works
3. **Handling permissions** in a user-friendly way
4. **Setting proper expectations** about privacy and functionality
5. **Providing a polished first impression** of the app

This creates a much more professional and user-friendly experience compared to the previous approach of just showing permission alerts.
