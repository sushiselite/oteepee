# OTeePee Distribution Guide üì¶

This guide covers everything you need to know about building, signing, and distributing your OTeePee app.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Building a Release

1. **Run the release build script:**
   ```bash
   ./release_build.sh
   ```

2. **Find your build artifacts in the `build/` directory:**
   - `OTeePee.app` - The application bundle
   - `OTeePee-vX.X.X.dmg` - DMG installer for easy distribution
   - `OTeePee-vX.X.X.zip` - ZIP archive for GitHub releases

## üîê Code Signing & Notarization

### For Personal Use (Self-Signed)
Your app will work on your own Mac but will show security warnings on other Macs.

### For Public Distribution (Recommended)

#### 1. Get an Apple Developer Account
- **Cost:** $99/year
- **Benefits:** 
  - Code signing with Developer ID
  - App notarization (removes security warnings)
  - Access to beta software
  - App Store distribution (if desired)

#### 2. Developer ID Certificate Setup
```bash
# Check available certificates
security find-identity -v -p codesigning

# Sign your app (replace with your Developer ID)
codesign --force --deep --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" build/Export/OTeePee.app
```

#### 3. Notarization Process
```bash
# Create a notarization-ready archive
ditto -c -k --keepParent build/Export/OTeePee.app OTeePee-notarization.zip

# Submit for notarization (requires app-specific password)
xcrun notarytool submit OTeePee-notarization.zip \
  --apple-id "your-apple-id@example.com" \
  --password "app-specific-password" \
  --team-id "YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
  --wait

# Staple the notarization ticket
xcrun stapler staple build/Export/OTeePee.app
```

## üìã Distribution Options

### 1. GitHub Releases (Recommended)
**Best for:** Open source projects, easy updates

**Steps:**
1. Create a new release on GitHub
2. Upload the ZIP file from `build/OTeePee-vX.X.X.zip`
3. Write release notes
4. Publish the release

**Download link format:**
```
https://github.com/yourusername/oteepee/releases/latest/download/OTeePee-vX.X.X.zip
```

### 2. Direct Download from Website
**Best for:** Professional distribution, custom landing pages

**Requirements:**
- Web hosting
- HTTPS (required for downloads)
- Optional: Download analytics

### 3. Mac App Store
**Best for:** Maximum reach, automatic updates

**Requirements:**
- Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
- App Store review process
- Compliance with App Store guidelines
- Sandboxing requirements

### 4. Third-Party Platforms
- **Homebrew Cask:** For developer-friendly distribution
- **MacUpdate, Softonic:** For broader reach

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Gatekeeper Compatibility
- **Signed + Notarized:** No warnings, best user experience
- **Signed only:** Warning dialog, user can override
- **Unsigned:** Multiple warnings, harder for users to install

### User Instructions for Unsigned Apps
If you distribute without a Developer ID:

1. **First launch warning:**
   - Right-click the app ‚Üí "Open"
   - Click "Open" in the dialog

2. **Alternative method:**
   - System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí General
   - Click "Open Anyway" next to the blocked app
